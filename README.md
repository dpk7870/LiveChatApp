## Introduction
This is a code repository for  a full Realtime Chat Application. I have used React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end.  To send and receive messages used web sockets and Socket.io to make any real-time application.


Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
